    "feature_use_case": "This is about being upfront about who owns the music the AI creates.  The system should tell you whether the generated music is copyrighted by the AI developers, by you (the user), or whether it's in the public domain.  It should also explain any restrictions on how you can use the music (e.g., can you use it commercially?)."
