    "feature_brief": "The AI automatically adds a \"watermark\" to the music it generates to identify it as AI-created.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is like a digital signature that identifies the music as being generated by an AI, not a human.  The watermark might be an inaudible signal embedded in the audio, or it could be a visible label.  This is important for preventing deception and for ensuring that people know when they're listening to AI-generated music."
