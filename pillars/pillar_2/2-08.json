    "feature_use_case": "This means the AI's output isn't completely random.  If you see an example of music generated by the AI that you like, you should be able to give the AI the same starting point (the \"prompt\") and get the same result.  This is important for demonstrating the AI's capabilities and for allowing users to experiment with different prompts to see how they affect the output."
