    "feature_use_case": "This goes beyond basic technical checks.  It's about assessing the music itself: Is it pleasant to listen to? Does it have a good structure? Does it evoke emotions? Does it follow basic principles of music theory (unless intentionally breaking them)?  This evaluation can involve both objective measures (e.g., analyzing the harmony) and subjective opinions (e.g., asking people to rate the music)."
