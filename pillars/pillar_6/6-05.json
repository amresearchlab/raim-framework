    "feature_use_case": "This is a more advanced form of plagiarism detection.  The system should have ways to check if the music it generates is too similar to existing copyrighted works. This is important for protecting the rights of human artists and for avoiding legal problems.  It might involve comparing the generated music to large databases of existing songs."
