    "feature_use_case": "This is about understanding the AI's \"musical background.\"  If the AI was only trained on Western classical music, it's likely to struggle with generating other genres, like hip-hop or traditional folk music.  Providing statistics about the training data helps users understand the AI's potential biases and limitations. It promotes transparency about the diversity (or lack thereof) in the AI's musical knowledge."
