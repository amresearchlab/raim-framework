        <p class="mb-0">Generative AI is radically changing the creative arts, transforming the way we create and
          interact with cultural artefacts.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While offering unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression, this technology also raises ethical,
        societal, and legal concerns. Key among these are the potential displacement of human creativity, copyright
        infringement stemming from vast training datasets, and the lack of transparency, explainability, and fairness
        mechanisms. In response to this, a coalition of organisations representing creative industries formed the <a
          class="lolink" href="https://www.humanartistrycampaign.com">Human Artistry Campaign</a>, advocating on behalf
        of the responsible use of creative AI. As generative systems become pervasive in this domain, responsible design
        is crucial.</p>

      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Responsible AI Music</span> (RAIM) is a collaborative initiative bringing
        together musicians, AI experts, ethicists, and legal experts to define, expand, and monitor requirements for
        generative music AI. Our goal is to work towards a framework providing guidance on the responsible development
        and use of generative models and system for music. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, we
        advocate for a tradeoff where artists and AI development collaborate in a way that <span
          class="font-italic">safeguards</span>, <span class="font-italic">inspires</span>, and <span
          class="font-italic">augments</span> human creativity and artistry.</p>

      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Can this be done by leveraging a Trustworthy AI framework?</span> This
        initiative takes a holistic approach, harmonising previous work that has tackled specific aspects of generative
        systems (e.g., transparency, evaluation, data), within the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI produced by the
        European Commission - a framework for designing responsible AI systems across 7 macro requirements. Focusing on
        generative music AI, we illustrate how these requirements can be contextualised for the field, addressing
        trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and integrating insights from the existing literature.</p>

      <h2>What is Trustworthy AI?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>Trustworthy AI encompasses artificial intelligence systems designed and implemented to adhere to
            fundamental ethical principles, technical robustness, and legal compliance.
            A referential work in this domain are the <a
              href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1">Ethics
              Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</a>, a document prepared by the <a

              Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent expert group appointed by the European Commission in 2018.</p>
          <p>The guidelines include 7 key requirements that AI systems should meet to be trustworthy:
          <ol>
            <li>Human agency and oversight</li>
            <li>Robustness and safety</li>
            <li>Privacy and data governance</li>
            <li>Transparency</li>

            <li>Societal and environmental wellbeing</li>
            <li>Accountability</li>
          </ol>
          These requirements are of general applicability and relate to different stakeholders in the systems' life
          cycle (developers, deployers, end-users, broader society). Following a piloting process with 350 stakeholders,
          the guidelines lead to the creation of the <a

      <h2>Guiding features for Responsible AI Music</h2>
      <p>We contextualise the Trustworthy AI framework to the domain of Generative AI Music, by defining responsible
        features that can drive the design and the evaluation of generative systems, in accordance with the literature.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/feature_diagram.png" class="img-fluid my-2" alt="Overview of features">

      <p>Before presenting each feature, let's start by introducing some jargon. When referring to Music AIs, a
        distinction needs to be made between <span class="font-italic">music model</span> and <span
          class="font-italic">generative music system</span>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A music <span class="font-weight-bold">model</span> can be defined as an algorithmic procedure that either
          encodes a set of rules explicitly, or learns them from the data and the task it is provided. These rules,
          e.g., a probability distribution for predicting the next note or chord in a piece, or a set of logical
          statements, can be used to generate, complete, or manipulate music.
        </li>
        <li>
          A generative music <span class="font-weight-bold">system</span> encompasses the whole computational
          infrastructure built on top of a music model to enable users to interact with the model and make use of its
          outputs, without the need of its inner workings. This includes both technical and the regulatory aspects, such
          as the interface, the logic which abstract or hide certain parameters of the model, the way the model's
          predictions are consumed; but also the data management system, the legal framework regulating the exchange of
          data, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Typically, a generative system is implemented in such a way as to conveniently wrap the functionalities of a
        particular model, meaning that a model can provide the computational backbone to various generative systems
        (e.g., plugins for music editors, production environments, smart instruments).
        For example, <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae">MusicVAE</a> has been reused in different
        applications, such as Beat Blender, Melody Mixer, Latent Loops, and is also available through <a
          href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/">Magenta Studio</a>, a plugin for the DAW Ableton Live.
        The distinction between model and system is a peculiar aspect to Generative AI, as their design and
        implementation involve different stakeholders, such as machine learning engineers and mathematicians for the
        former, and UX designers, software developers, data engineers for the latter, but also share music experts as a
        common denominator driving the evaluation efforts.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 1: Human Agency and Oversight</h3>
      <p>Central to the design of trustworthy systems is the capacity of individuals to understand and meaningfully
        influence the actions of AI systems (<em>human agency</em>) while monitoring and interacting their behaviour to
        operate responsibly and align with human values and preferences (<em>human oversight</em>).</p>

            <h2>Personalisation</h2>
            <p>Personalisation allows a musician to use the system to create stylised music based on their existing
              repertoire, so that the music produced will fit into the musicians repertoire more easily when released.
              It also means that the user will be better able to influence the output of the system by personalising it
              based on certain songs.</p>
            <p>For the musician using this AI, this will mean that before running the system, they are asked to
              (optionally) upload files containing their musical repertoire - they will also need to be able to prove
              that they hold copyrights to the files uploaded. Then the AI model will train to focus on the uploaded
              music, so that the product will be similar to the input.</p>

            <h2>Creative feedback (HITL)</h2>
            <p>Creative feedback is an example of a Human In The Loop (HITL) framework. This means that a human is able
              to intervene in each decision taken by the AI - in this case by giving feedback on the music that the AI
              has produced, to improve the quality of its output and give the human more control over what is created
              and tailor it to their own specific music taste.</p>
            <p>When a user runs the system, they would have the opportunity to rate the songs produced by the AI after
              each episode in the training cycle to help the model adapt to the tastes of the user. Training will only
              be able to complete once the user is satisfied with the result.</p>

            <p>Controllability is another important way for the user to control the output of the music generation
              system. It allows the user to influence the music being created through text prompts, as well as providing
              melodies, harmonic progressions, or rhythms for the AI to incorporate into its generation.</p>
            <p>The user would be provided with a way to input text or upload files for the system to use upon starting,

            <p>Creatives are likely to be the most affected group by the rising usage of AI generated music. Therefore
              it will be important that the future of AI usage in music takes into account the considerations of

              ethical requirements are being met satisfactorily during the development of the software.</p>
            <p>Musicians may also be able to provide a lot of useful insight to the development of a music generation
              system, that might otherwise be missed by a computer scientist.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 4: Transparency</h3>
      <p>This requirement is closely linked with the principle of explainability and encompasses transparency of
        elements relevant to generative systems, e.g., the data, the system, and the business model. Hereafter, we
        outline the main elements influencing the transparency of these systems.</p>

            <p>Most users of music generation software are likely to be musicians or music listeners. Both of these
              groups are unlikely to be experts on generative AI, however it helps with transparency if the users can
              understand the inner workings of software that they are using - at least to some degree.</p>
            <p>One way that this can be achieved is by using the concept of harmonic memory, which generates chord
              sequences based on user prompts, which is easier to explain for a musician.</p>

            <h2>Training footprint</h2>
            <p>By disclosing a "training footprint" for the user, the system can take account for its cost and
              environmental impact. This helps to inform users of the impact of the AI model, so that they can
              effectively make their own choices around environmental AI usage.</p>
            <p>There could be an information screen detailing key information, such as the hardware used to train the
              model, the time it took, and the amount of energy that was consumed.</p>

            <p>After a model has been trained, it still uses up resources to generate content. A responsible music
              generation system should provide some kind of indication of the hardware, time and energy consumed to
              generate content, to inform users of the environmental cost of their usage of AI.</p>
            <p>After a user has generated an item of media, the system could calculate the cost that this action has
              incurred and provide the user with this information.</p>

            <p>The training data required for an AI - especially a responsible one - may require annotation, which must
              be done by a human. Similarly it is highly possible that crowdsourcing may be used to collect data, and
              humans may be used for data collection and evaluation. In these circumstances, it is important that the
              human actors are being treated fairly and ethically, and annotators may be compensated for their work.</p>

            <h2>Social purpose</h2>
            <p>Music AI has significant potential to bring societal benefits, and can be used for example in education
              to help with the understanding of music theory, or to improve the mental state of a listener by reducing
              stress. Music AI could also improve the accessibility of creative technologies, allowing them to create
              music in novel ways.</p>
            <p>An AI system could be designed with these goals in mind in order to maximise its 'responsibility', and
              avoid some of the negative impacts of AI on the music industry.</p>

            <h2>IP validation</h2>
            <p>For an AI system to be societally responsible, it is important that it can determine how much it copies
              from the data that it is trained on.</p>
            <p>There already exist some solutions to this - for example, there is the 'originality report' which is a
              framework for measuring the extent to which a music AI copies its training data. This could be used to
              help detect plagiarism and IP infringement in the generations produced by the AI model.</p>

              artistic creations.</p>
            <p>If the AI system is paid-for, a percentage of its profits could go towards the artists who have
              contributed training material. This would also be able to raise funds to to assist authors who whose work
              has been disrupted by generative AI.</p>

            <p>This particularly applies when the generative system cannot accommodate one or more responsible features,

            <p>Trade-offs should be carefully selected to prioritise the minimisation of risks to ethical principles. If
