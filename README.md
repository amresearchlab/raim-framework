# RAIM Initiative

**Responsible AI Music (RAIM)** is a collaborative initiative dedicated to establishing a framework for responsible innovation in generative music AI. We believe that by fostering a dialogue amongst musicians, AI experts, ethicists, and legal experts, we can guide the development and use of generative models and systems that safeguard, inspire, and augment human creativity.

This repository hosts the website for the RAIM Initiative, providing a platform to trigger discussions and encourage participation from the wider community. Our proposed features, rooted in the Trustworthy AI framework, serve as a starting point for this crucial conversation.
